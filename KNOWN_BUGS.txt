Known bugs:

- sometimes structres are not correctly aligned to 4 but rather to 8,
passing -m32 does not help!
-- affected files: complexstruct.h, basictypes.h, seems to happen when a REAL8 is created
- nested structures does not work
- defines are not implemented (basics of A EQU B only on constant defines)
- comments are not preserved (and probably won't be)
