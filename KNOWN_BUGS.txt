Known bugs:
- Altrough this is not an issue, ch2inc generated p function in funcandglobalvar.h
- nested structures does not work
- defines are not implemented (basics of A EQU B only on constant defines)

Possible libclang bugs:
- When declaring "extern int" with "-mrtd" the function is incorrectly defaulted as __cdecl and not __stdcall like H2INC?
